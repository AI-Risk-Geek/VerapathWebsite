            <h2>Collection of information</h2>
            <p>
                Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy. We may
                process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Website and
                Services. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and
                establish statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and Services. This
                statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular
                user of the system.
            </p>

        <section id="use-processing">
            <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
            <p>
                We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have
                entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and
                we would be the data processor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act
                in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is
                necessary to ensure your access and use of the Website and Services. In such instances, we are a data
                controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information.
            </p>
            <p>
                We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through
                the Website and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal
                Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In
                such instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may
                need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we
                request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the
                information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
                <li>Run and operate the Website and Services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where
                you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (a) you have given your consent for
                one or more specific purposes; (b) provision of information is necessary for the performance of this
                Policy with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (c) processing is necessary for
                compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (d) processing is related to a task that
                is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (e)
                processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third
                party.
            </p>
            <p>We rely on user’s consent as a legal base upon which we collect and process your Personal Information.</p>
            <p>
                Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
                processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases above. In
                any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in
                particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or
                a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

                However, we may also disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or
                permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in
                good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of
                others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

                obligations, to enforce our Policy, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required
                or permitted by law.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you
                update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period
                expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure,
                the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration
                of the retention period.

                Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your Personal
                Information in a country other than your own. Where required by applicable laws, we will ensure that
                such transfers are based on appropriate legal grounds, including obtaining your explicit consent or
                implementing necessary safeguards to protect your Personal Information.

                    the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to
                    erasure such as where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and
                    information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, to exercise or
                    defense of legal claims.

                    that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and, if
                    technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance from us,

                Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not
                want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information
                in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally
                identifiable information from users who use or visit a website or online service as they move across
                different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As
                a result, the Website and Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals
                communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit
